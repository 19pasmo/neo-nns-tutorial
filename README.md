# How to Use Neo Name Service (NNS)

## Introduction
This tutorial will guide you through using the **Neo Name Service (NNS)**, a decentralized domain name system on the Neo blockchain. By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to register a domain, manage it, and link it to a wallet address.

## Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following:
1. A Neo Wallet (e.g., NeoLine or O3 Wallet).
2. Testnet GAS for transactions (you can get it from the Neo faucet).
3. Basic understanding of blockchain concepts.

## Step 1: Access the Neo Name Service (NNS)
1. Open your Neo Wallet (e.g., NeoLine or O3 Wallet).
2. Navigate to the **dApps** section and search for **Neo Name Service (NNS)**.
3. Connect your wallet to the NNS dApp.

## Step 2: Register a Domain
1. **Search for a Domain**:
   - Enter your desired domain name (e.g., `myname.neo`) in the search bar.
   - Check if the domain is available.

2. **Register the Domain**:
   - If the domain is available, click **Register**.
   - Confirm the transaction in your wallet and pay the registration fee (in GAS).

3. **Wait for Confirmation**:
   - The domain registration will be processed on the Neo blockchain.
   - Once confirmed, the domain will be linked to your wallet address.

## Step 3: Manage Your Domain
1. **View Your Domain**:
   - Go to the **My Domains** section in the NNS dApp.
   - You will see a list of domains registered to your wallet.

2. **Update Domain Information**:
   - You can update the domainâ€™s linked wallet address or other details.
   - Click **Update** and confirm the transaction in your wallet.

3. **Renew Your Domain**:
   - Domains need to be renewed periodically.
   - Click **Renew** and pay the renewal fee (in GAS).

---

## Step 4: Use Your Domain
1. **Link to a Wallet Address**:
   - Use your domain (e.g., `myname.neo`) as a human-readable address for receiving NEO or GAS.
   - Share your domain with others instead of your wallet address.

2. **Integrate with dApps**:
   - Some dApps support NNS domains for easier interaction.
   - Use your domain to log in or interact with supported dApps.

## Conclusion
Congratulations! You have successfully registered and managed a domain using the Neo Name Service (NNS). You can now use your domain for easier transactions and dApp interactions.
